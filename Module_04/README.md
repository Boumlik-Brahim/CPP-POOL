##  Subtype polymorphism (runtime polymorphism):

It's the ability to use derived classes through base class pointers and references.Subtype polymorphism is also called runtime polymorphism for a good reason. The resolution of polymorphic function calls happens at runtime through an indirection via the virtual table. Another way of explaining this is that compiler does not locate the address of the function to be called at compile-time, instead when the program is run, the function is called by dereferencing the right pointer in the virtual table.
##  abstract classes:

##  interfaces:
